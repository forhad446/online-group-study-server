## Online Group Study Server

Welcome to the server-side code repository for our Online Group Study platform! This project serves as the backbone for facilitating seamless communication, data management, and authentication between users and our platform's frontend. Powered by Express.js and MongoDB, our server ensures secure data storage, efficient request handling, and reliable user authentication.

- Utilize the robustness and flexibility of Express.js to handle HTTP requests and route traffic effectively.

- Leverage MongoDB's NoSQL database to store user data, assignment details, exam questions, and study materials securely.
